# PocketFresh

  The app will be designed and act as a “pocket mom” for our users, acting as a “one-stop-shop” for all questions instead of users having to google things, as well as  guiding and educating users while they are shopping alone at the supermarket.
We notice that not all college students and young professionals prefer cooking their meals rather than buying food at the restaurant. That is why we filter our target audience specifically for people who have the curiosity to cook and choose the best ingredients in the grocery stores. 

  The main focus of our app would be that users can look up fresh produce, such as fruits and vegetables, in a search bar or by scanning the item, and they will be redirected to the product details page. The product details page helps users understand how to choose the best product (for example, how do you know when a watermelon is ripe? When are watermelons in season?), familiarize themselves with different ingredients ( for example, how long will item X stay good in the fridge for?) and suggest recipes for different ingredients.
